Check [RoboBoard X4 programming](/roboboard-x4) and documentation to control all its features.

Control Totem robots remotely using [Totem App](remote-control/app). Also check for [other ways to interact with RoboBoard X4](/remote-control).

### Use TotemBUS modules

RoboBoard X4 allows to expand it's functionality by attaching TotemBUS supported modules. Read [Modules documentation](/modules) to find all about it.

### Use Qwiic modules

RoboBoard X4 has a [QwiicÂ®](roboboard-x4/qwiic/) connector to plug in third-party modules. This allows to greatly expand things you can do with it, not limiting to Totem ecosystem.
