## Introduction

TotemBUS is a unique modular system that can have any configuration of functionality. Multiple modules with different capabilities (motor control, sensors, etc.) can be combined to build a sophisticated robots with a lot of programmable functionality. This is possible by using [Totem modules](/modules/), communicating over [TotemBUS](/TotemBUS/) protocol and controlling via [Totem API](API/).

## Setting-up environment
