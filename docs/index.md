TotemBUS is a unique modular system that can have any configuration of functionality. Multiple modules with different capabilities (motor control, sensors, etc.) can be combined to build a sophisticated robots with a lot of programmable functionality. This is possible by using [Totem modules](/modules/00.info/), communicating over [TotemBUS](/TotemBUS/) protocol and controlling via [Totem API](API/About/).
