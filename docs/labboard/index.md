This board has a dual use - firstly it can be used as an expansion board to the TotemDuino system, offering easily accessible input and output connections, and secondly
- it is a measuring and testing unit, containing multiple features.

LabBoard is designed to be mounted onto Totem beams and boards, as well as to the third part surfaces, with a help of a few bolts and brackets.

If you’re just starting tinkering with electronics and microcontroller programming, LabBoard is perfect for you! It comes with many crucial instruments that will give you a boost and be helpful for someone who is either just starting, or is an advanced DIY enthusiast.

## Features

- **Digital to Analog converter** - converter outputting a pre-set voltage:
    - 3 channels in the 0..3.25 Volt range (DAC1, DAC2, DAC3)
    - 1 channel in the 3..14 Volt range (VREG)
- **Voltage measure** - three inputs in the ±0.5 V, ±5V and ±50V range.
- **Current measure** - sensing current up to 800 mA.
- **Frequency meter** - digital signal frequency measurement module for signals up to 23 MHz.
- **Pulse counter** - digital signal pulse counter, counting up to 999999999 pulses.
- **Pulse generator** - unit capable of generating finite or infinite series of pulses, with programmable pulse width and period.
- **Serial monitor** - View serial data output from Arduino and interact with LED and buttons.
