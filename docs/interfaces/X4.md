# X4

Used **only** with Totem [X4 module](/modules/04) to enable all functionality and on-board features:

* Implements all X4 module functionality.
* Makes X4 module discoverable over Bluetooth.
* Provides direct access to `TotemModule` functions (`Totem.X4.write("indicate")`).
* Enables passthrough to communicate with external modules connected over TotemBUS.

```arduino
void setup() {
  Totem.X4.begin(); // Initialize X4 interface
}
```

## Disabling Bluetooth

By default X4 module makes itself discoverable over Bluetooth in order for mobile applications or other modules to connect and control it. This functionality takes a lot of space in flash memory and increases compile and upload times. If this feature isn't needed, Bluetooth can be disabled with custom initialization call `Totem.X4.beginNoBluetooth()`. This reduces compiled application size and allows faster development.

```arduino
void setup() {
  Totem.X4.beginNoBluetooth(); // Will utilize 50% less flash memory
}
```
