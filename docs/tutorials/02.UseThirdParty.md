# Use third-party boards

*[MCU]: Microcontroller Unit
*[BLE]: Bluetooth Low Energy

[Totem Library](https://github.com/totemmaker/TotemArduino/){target=_blank} supports all ESP32 based development boards. It includes required functionality for [X4 Module](/modules/04) and allows to use some features with third-party development boards.  
Irrespective of product, all ESP32 MCU has integrated BLE connectivity. Library utilizes it by allowing to connect and control Totem modules wirelessly.  
For using with [X4 Module](/modules/04) - set up with `Totem.X4.begin()`.  
For using BLE feature with third-party boards - set up with `Totem.BLE.begin()`.  
For more about interfaces - read [Interfaces information](/interfaces/).

!!! warning "Notice"
    `Totem.X4.begin()` should be used when compiling code for [X4 Module](/modules/04). Using this initialization for other boards will result in runtime error.  
    [X4 Module](/modules/04) is able to use both interfaces at the same time, if required:  
    ```arduino
    void setup() {
        Totem.X4.begin();
        Totem.BLE.begin();
    }
    ```

## Using library with [ESP32 DevKitC](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.1.5/get-started/get-started-devkitc.html){target=_blank}
![ESP32 Devkit](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.1.5/_images/esp32-devkitc-functional-overview1.jpg)

To set up a project with ESP32 DevKitC follow these steps:

=== "PlatformIO"
    1. Click `+ New Project`. A window will open:  
    ![PlatformIO new project](/assets/images/platformio_ide_3.png){style="width: 80%;"}
    1. Fill in fields:  
        **Name:** type in any project name.  
        **Board:** select `Espressif ESP32 Dev Module`.  
        _If using another board that is listed - select it._  
        **Framework:** select Arduino Framework.  
    1. Click `Finish` and project will be created.  
    1. PlatformIO icon → `PIO Home` → `Libraries` → Tab `Installed` → select `Totem Library`.  
    1. In `Examples` tab select "BLE\X3_FBI_LedBlink".  
        _Or "BLE\X4_LedBlink" to control X4 board._  
    1. Copy all **X3_FBI_LedBlink.ino** file content to **src/main.cpp** file (located in Explorer).  
        _Click View → Explorer if you don't see project files list._  
    1. Make sure initialization is set to `Totem.BLE.begin()` inside `setup()` function.  
    1. Connect ESP32 DevKitC to PC.  
    1. Select PlatformIO: Upload.  
        _At this stage code should compile without errors and upload to ESP32 DevKitC._  
    1. Now select PlatformIO: Serial Monitor and you should start seeing text displayed.  

=== "Arduino IDE"
    1. Select `Tools` → `Board` → `ESP32 Arduino` → `ESP32 Dev Module`.  
        _If using another board that is listed - select it._  
        Other default settings:  
        **Upload Speed:** 921600  
        **CPU Frequency:** 240Mhz  
        **Flash Frequency:** 80Mhz  
        **Flash Mode:** QIO  
        **Flash Size:** 4MB  
        **Partition Scheme:** Default 4MB with spiffs  
        **Core Debug Level:** None  
        **PSRAM:** Disabled  
    1. Click `File` → `Examples`.
    1. Scroll down to `Examples from Custom Libraries`.
    1. Select `Totem Library` and open "BLE → X3_FBI_LedBlink" example.  
        _Or "BLE → X4_LedBlink" to control X4 board._  
    1. A window will open with selected project.  
        _If modifying an example project - Arduino IDE will ask to save it as a new project._
    1. Make sure initialization is set to `Totem.BLE.begin()` inside `setup()` function.  
    1. Connect ESP32 DevKitC to PC.  
    1. Click `Tools` → `Port` and select port displayed there.  
        _If `Port` is not available - check if board is on and plugged to PC with USB cable._  
        _If there are multiple ports, disconnect USB cable and check which one is gone. Reconnect and select it._  
    1. Click `Tools` → `Serial Monitor`. A window will open. It will display output from connected board. Leave it open.  
        _Set **baud** to 115200._
    1. Click `Sketch` → `Upload` and wait till it completes.  
        _At this stage code should compile without errors and upload to ESP32 DevKitC._  
        _After upload, you should start seeing text displayed in Serial Monitor._
