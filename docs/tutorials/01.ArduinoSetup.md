# Arduino setup

Arduino is a well known framework for integrated development environments. By using Arduino and [Totem Library](https://github.com/totemmaker/TotemArduino){target=_blank}, a microcontroller can be programmed to use Totem modules for sensing or controlling external equipment, like motors and lights.

To start with Arduino, a development environment is required. Currently there are 2 most popular choices:

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/software){target=_blank} - an original Arduino development environment with a basic functionality, but easy understandable for **beginners**.
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org){target=_blank} - a development environment built on top of Visual Studio Code editor with all modern features like code indexing, autocomplete and much more for **advanced** users.

!!! note "Requirements"
    This tutorial presumes you have [X4 module](/modules/04) and the following guide will instruct how to setup a project with it. It's also possible to use [third-party ESP32 boards](/tutorials/02.UseThirdParty/).

Choose which one to continue with:

=== "Setup Arduino IDE"
    ![Arduino IDE](/assets/images/arduino_ide_1.png)
    Original Arduino IDE stands out with it's simple design, allowing to compile a project and upload it to the microcontroller. This is one of the reasons why it's so popular among beginners. Aside from basic functionality, it has thousands of third-party libraries and code examples to create a project even faster.

    !!! warning
        Make sure you are running Arduino version **1.8.13** or later. Older version won't work.
    
    !!! bug
        [ESP32 Arduino Core](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32){target=_blank} contains a bug, that doesn't allow to compile the project (error: `undefined reference`).
