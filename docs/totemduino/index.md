## About

TotemDuino expands upon the great Arduino UNO platform idea. While it is kept fully backwards compatible with Arduino, a lot of additional features are included as well, such as:

* **Output protection** - nothing limits creativity as the fear of making a mistake and breaking something. TotemDuino comes with all of its output pins going into LabBoard protected against over-voltage or short-circuit conditions. No experiment could go wrong this way!
* **Expansion port** - a 34 pin flat-cable connection connects to the LabBoard for easy pin access.
* **Powerful 5 V regulator** - you'll be less likely to run out of power while experimenting with higher power loads such as motors.
* **Selectable microcontroller logic voltage** - as the world progresses from 5 V towards 3.3 V logic voltage, TotemDuino can work with both just by the flip of a switch, without the need for any additional adapters or converters.
