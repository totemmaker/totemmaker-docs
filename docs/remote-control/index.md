# Remote control

Totem products can be controlled remotely (wired and wireless) from other devices or development platforms. We are adding interfaces for more flexible ways to integrate Totem products into your custom projects.  

## Interfaces

Different ways to connect to X3 and X4 boards. Click on selected interface for more information.  

* [Arduino](../modules/ble/index.md) - Control X3 and X4 from any ESP32 (BLE capable) product using Arduino.  
* [Totem App](app/index.md) - Control X3, X4 and robots using mobile Totem App.  
* [PS3/PS4 controller](ps-controller.md) - Control X4 using PS3 or PS4 remote controller.
