## Board Cutter

[![Board Cutter Usage](../assets/images/products/tools/board-cutter-usage.png){loading=lazy}](../assets/images/products/tools/board-cutter-usage.png)

A simple Tool Kit based on retractable knife and specifically designed ruler:

- Ruler pins fits to Totem Board grid in 45° or 90° angles.
- Prevents moving around while cutting.
- Contains inlet for straight cuts.

Tools are included in [Totem Maker Kit](https://totemmaker.net/product/totem-maker-kit/){target=_blank} and Totem [XL Maker Kit](https://totemmaker.net/product/totem-xl-maker-kit/){target=_blank}.
