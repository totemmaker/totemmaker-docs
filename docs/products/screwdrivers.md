**Push nuts into beam** with help of the screwdriver. Use your fingers to enter the first rectangular slot. Then push the nut in, using the back of the screwdriver. The nut almost always tilts, so use your finger to straighten it. Then push it all the way in.

When you get the hang of it, try pushing the nut holding the screwdriver in an angular position, like it is shown in the picture. That way you avoid tilting problem.

What about getting them out?
Use the tip (hex bit) of the screwdriver to push the nut out 2/3 of the slot. Then pull the nut by the thread.
