# Setup programming tools

In order to start programming with Totem products, a development environment is required. We use Arduino framework, as it is well known and easy to start with. Totem provides full integration and documentation, so only a few steps required to get started.  

At the moment there are 2 supported choices to program RoboBoard X4:

| [Arduino IDE](arduino-ide) |
| :-----: |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Original Arduino development environment with basic functionality, but easy understandable for **beginners**. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |


| [PlatformIO](platformio) |

| Development environment built on top of Visual Studio Code editor with all modern features like code indexing, autocomplete and much more for **advanced** users. |
